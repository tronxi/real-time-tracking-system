\section*{\tituloPortadaEngVal}

The main objective of this work is the development of a real-time data visualization platform for CanSat-type projects, designed to be reusable in different projects with different hardware configurations.  
To validate the proposed solution, a functional prototype has been built based on a CanSat, integrating different types of sensors, a GNSS module, radiofrequency transmission, and a camera, all connected to the platform.

The developed platform is structured into independent modules (data acquisition, transmission, backend, and frontend) that can be easily adapted to new configurations without the need to modify the system as a whole.  
This approach facilitates system modification and its integration into other contexts with similar requirements.

During development, all key stages have been addressed, from data acquisition and processing to real-time visualization.  
Functionality tests have been carried out demonstrating both the robustness of the architecture and the practical usefulness of the system.
